Standalone ATNOS/CANDID package

Copyright and Legal Information


Date: August 1, 2005

ATNOS/CANDID is a software package for automated NOESY spectral analysis that provides the functionalities of the two existing algorithms ATNOS for automated peak picking and NOE identification in 2D homonuclear and 3D heteronuclear-resolved NOESY spectra, and CANDID for automated NOE assignment of NOESY cross peaks in conjunction with protein three-dimensional structure calculation. The following is legal information pertaining to the use of the ATNOS/CANDID program. It applies to all ATNOS/CANDID files, i.e. executable (binary) files, configuration files, documentation files contained in the official ATNOS/CANDID archives. All of these are referred to here as "the software".

THIS NOTICE MUST ACCOMPANY ALL OFFICIAL OR CUSTOM ATNOS/CANDID FILES. IT MAY NOT BE REMOVED OR MODIFIED. THIS INFORMATION PERTAINS TO ALL USE OF THE PACKAGE WORLDWIDE. THIS DOCUMENT SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUS LICENSES OR DISTRIBUTION POLICIES.
