*rosetta++-2.3.0 (03 Dec 2008)

  11 Dec 2008; Hugo Mildenberger <Hugo.Mildenberger@t-online.de>;
  - Renamed ebuild from 'rosetta' to 'rosetta++'
  - Renamed ebuild directory, patches and license likewise
  - Removed explicit sys-apps/* dependencies from DEPEND 
  - Removed rosetta license copy from files/static/rosetta 
  - Commented each patch inside the patch itself
  - Combined several patches against barcode_classes.h into a single file
  - Removed patch against tools/build/basic.settings
  - Added patch against tools/build/user.settings and got icc working
  - Ebuild now compiles ok with:
    gcc 4.2.4-r1 p1.0, builtin ssp,fortify, pie-9.0.11
    gcc 4.3.2 p1.1
    icc 10.1.018
  - TODO: When using gcc 3.3.6-1, build still fails in dock_ensemble.cc:678,
    at a suspiciously looking construct (taking address of a temporary?). 
    Same problem in dock_loop_ensemble.cc, pose_docking_flexible.cc.
    A similar problem exists in epigraft_functions.hh:59-61. 
    Perhaps someone experienced with the ObjexxFCL fortran/c++ class 
    library could fix this?
  - TODO: The boinc target still does not compile with any compiler, as does
    the test target, both to an invalid scons build setup. Don't know how
    to fix this.

  - Thanks to J. Schmitz <jlec@j-schmitz.net> for reviewing and testing
