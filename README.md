last-hope gentoo portage overlay
==========

A gentoo portage overlay with a set of too exotic, or unusal ebuilds for the sunrise overlay or the main gentoo portage tree.
Home of the only ebuild for the great mucommander, and several other not well-known tools.

- [A complete list of all ebuilds in the overlay](http://j-schmitz.net/gentoo/last-hope )
- [Follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/LastHopeOverlay)

The overlay is in the the layman's global repository.xml, so you can simply run `layman -a last-hope` to install the overlay.

If you wish to contribute to the overlays fork us, we will merge.
