last-hope gentoo portage overlay
==========

A gentoo portage overlay with a set of too exotic, or unusal ebuilds for the sunrise overlay or the main gentoo portage tree.
Home of the only ebuild for the great mucommander, and several other not well-known tools. Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/LastHopeOverlay

Fork us, we will merge.

**Note:** we are currently migrating the self-hosted subversion repository to github. Expect some oddities and hiccups. For the meantime visit http://www.j-schmitz.net/gentoo/last-hope for a full list of ebuilds in the overlay.
